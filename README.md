## Pokedex iOS App

- This App displays a list of pokemons and their detailed view, obtained from an API using URLSession.
- Pokemon data is retrieved with pagination, which ensures better performance of the app.
- Pokemon data is stored using a cache system to improve performance.
- The architechture used in this project is MVVM and Delegate Pattern.
- This project also abstracts Data Manage, therefore we can find a DataManager which fullfills Repository Pattern requirements.
- Its interface is implemented using SwiftUI, which ensures a reactive response.
- UI has a searchable text field, which allow users to filter pokemons by name, types or abilities.

# How it works

- Just below you can find a video of the project running.
